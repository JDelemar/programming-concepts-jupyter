Design Patterns

## Types

- Types
  - Creational patterns: Focus on object creation mechanisms
    - Factory method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singleton
  - Structural patterns: Deals with object composition and class relationships
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy
  - Behavioral patterns: Concentrate on communication between objects and classes
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer - Allows a one-to-many communication between objects so that when one object changes state (subject/observable), all its dependents are notified and updated automatically (observers/subscriber)
    - State
    - Strategy - Allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable at runtime
    - Template Method
    - Visitor

## Defining Relationships

- Defining Relationships
  - Types of relations defined for classes under UML supported by mermaid
